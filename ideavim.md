# IdeaVim

If you are a vimer and somehow use Jetbrains IDEs...(you may not a pure vimer lol), you definitely know ideavim, which is a vim emulation plugin for Jetbrains IDEs.

See more on their official site hosted on [Github - ideavim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)

# How to Use

It's quite like naive vim and you will feel familiar with that.

There's a so called `.ideavimrc` file and simply link it on your `$HOME`.

```shell
$ ln -sf $PWD/.ideavimrc $HOME/.ideavimrc
```

# Leader Key

It's `SPC`.
